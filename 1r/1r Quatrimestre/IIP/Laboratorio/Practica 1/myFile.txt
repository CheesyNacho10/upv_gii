This first lab activity has as objective that the student gets familiar
with the different elements of the working environment that will be used
during the course. Specifically, the student will learn to:

- Employ basic commands of the Linux operating system
- Organise its working directories
- Use a text editor, like Emacs
- Employ compilation and execution commans for a Java program
  from the command line
- Employ the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) BlueJ for
  editing, compiling, and executing a Java program

The student must read in detail the statement of the lab activity,
in order to get focused into the part that is going to be developed
in the lab. Since it is the first lab activity, no previous knowledge
is required.
