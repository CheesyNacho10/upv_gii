lesson One

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,800
the references shown can help
 the study of this lesson

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,860
A central concept in the theory
 of automata and languages

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,640
it's the concept of
 formal language

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,350
to reach it we will start from
 the definition of alphabet

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,530
an alphabet is defined as
any non-empty finite set

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,000
Its items will be called
 symbols or letters

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,050
some examples of
alphabets are

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,020
the alphabet of two
symbols a and b...

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,050
or the set of binary
digits zero, one...

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,350
the set of
decimal digits,

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,060
or the lowercase letters of the
 alphabet are also alphabets

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,160
as well as the set of all the different
 words contained in Don Quixote

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,920
To denote alphabets we will usually
 use uppercase Greek letters

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,970
as sigma, delta, gamma

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,910
Using the symbols of an alphabet,
the words or strings are build

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,750
which represent the equivalent of
sentences in natural language.

19
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,980
A word is a finite
sequence of symbols,

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:29,330
to identify words we will use the lowercase
symbols of the Latin alphabet u, v, w, etc.

21
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,920
as examples of words, and
given the alphabet a, b

22
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,320
a and bbab, among others,
 are valid words.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,740
Given a word sometimes we
will refer to its length

24
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,650
that is, the number of
symbols that compose it

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,990
the length is usually noted by
enclosing the identifier between bars

26
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,960
of the word

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,480
as an example if we
consider the word bbab

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,920
we see that its
length is four

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,590
the existence of the
zero-length word is admitted

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,970
this will be denoted
with the lambda symbol

31
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,460
sometimes it will be useful to refer
 to the number of occurrences

32
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,770
of a symbol in a word

33
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:34,220
we denote this number by adding
 a sub-index to the bars

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,110
which denoted the
length of a word

35
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,110
thus if x is equal
to the word bbab

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,670
so the number of occurrences
 of symbol a in x is one

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,700
and the number of occurrences
of the symbol b in x is three

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,170
An interesting set of words
 on a sigma alphabet

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,420
is the set of words
of a given length n

40
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,980
this set will be denoted using
 n as an exponent of sigma

41
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,810
as examples, and given
Sigma equal to a, b

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,740
Sigma zero is the set containing
 exclusively the word lambda

43
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,640
and Sigma three is the set of all the
words of as and bs of length three

44
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,970
another set of interest is
that of all possible words

45
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,390
we will denote this
set as Sigma star

46
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,650
a little more formally as the
 union of all sets Sigma i

47
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,140
where i is an integer

48
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,020
we will also refer to
the whole set of words

49
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,960
over sigma of length
greater than zero

50
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,140
this set will be
denoted as Sigma plus

51
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,910
obviously, the relationship between the
sigma star and sigma mas sets is close

52
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,960
the set Sigma star can be
ordered in different ways

53
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,780
one of them is the
so-called canonical order

54
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,130
this order states that one
word precedes another if

55
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,220
its length is smaller

56
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,060
or if it is before alphabetically
when words have the same length

57
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,400
As an example taking again
 sigma equal to a, b

58
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,380
bb is previous to aaa

59
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,590
and aba is
previous to baa

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,700
we also show the numbering
 of the first words

61
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,290
of sigma star using
the canonical order

62
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,540
an internal operation called
concatenation is defined in sigma star

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,920
given two words this operation
 returns the word resulting

64
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,080
of arranging the symbols
of the second word after

65
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,320
the symbols of
 the first

66
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,250
as examples, it is shown the
 result of concatenating 

67
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:15,760
aab and bbab as well as
concatenating lambda and bab

68
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,370
also mention that the dot
operator is usually omitted

69
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,710
We also mention also that the concatenation
 is associative and has neutral element

70
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,190
and that it is
not commutative

71
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,720
to shorten the notation when
a symbol or piece of word

72
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,920
repeats n times it is denoted
using exponential notation

73
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,660
in this way given
 any word x

74
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,090
x to zero is lambda
and x to one is x

75
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,290
as examples, the result of
aab to the cube is shown

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,400
of lambda to the
 seventeenth

77
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,820
and of a to two
b to the cube

78
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,490
the reverse of a word
 is also defined

79
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,680
as the resulting word of reading
the symbols from right to left

80
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,040
as examples

81
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,460
the reverse of
lambda is lambda

82
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,870
and the reverse of aaba is the same
 word since it is a palindrome.

83
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,670
some of the properties of
 the reverse are shown

84
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,280
segments of a word are
also defined as any

85
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,160
sequence of
consecutive symbols

86
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,940
every initial segment is a prefix
 and every final segment is

87
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,160
a suffix of the word

88
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,920
as an example

89
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,960
given the word

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
of the screen

91
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,420
some of its
segments are

92
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,440
bac, bb, acc,
and lambda

93
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,920
among its
prefixes are a

94
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,880
aba among others

95
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,210
and some of its
suffixes are

96
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,590
bbacc, the same
word, or lambda

97
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,530
we will denote with x Seg
the set of segments of x

98
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,910
with Pref of x the set of prefixes
 of x and with Suf of x the set

99
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,070
of suffixes of x

100
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,670
we show as an example the
sets of segments, prefixes

101
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,760
and suffixes of
the word aba

102
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,910
defined word, alphabet,
and set of all possible

103
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,280
words, we get to the
notion of language

104
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,250
given any alphabet sigma
a language is any set

105
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,510
of words over sigma

106
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,310
that is, any subset
 of sigma star

107
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,250
as an example, and given
the alphabet zero, one

108
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,110
the set of all words starting
 with zero is a language

109
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,250
what can be more formally
 denoted as shown

110
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,590
the set of words with the same
 number of zeros and ones

111
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,990
is also a language

112
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,840
which can be easily noted using the
 number of occurrences operator

113
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,710
that we have
seen before

114
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,780
Another language, is the set of
words with length less than three

115
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,360
this can be fully enumerated
because it is a finite language

116
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,980
the set of palindromes over
 zero, one is a language

117
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,320
what can be noted
using the operator

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,310
reverse as shown

119
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,650
Other languages are zero one
star, zero one more, the set

120
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,120
of words of length four

121
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,540
empty language or language
containing exclusively lambda
