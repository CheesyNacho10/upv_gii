00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,280
This video intuitively describes
 the boolean operations

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
on formal languages

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,330
we insist on the intuitive
 nature of the talk

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,880
and refer the student to the bibliography and the rest
of the available material to delve into formal aspects

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,880
to delve into
formal aspects

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,660
When we refer to
Boolean operations

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,270
we do it to three well-known
operations on the set theory

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,840
the union, the intersection,
 and the complementary

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,260
identically to how these
operations are defined in the

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,780
mentioned set theory,

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,680
given a set of words on
a given alphabet sigma

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,760
and two languages
 L1 and L2

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,830
the union of L1 and L2 languages
 consists of considering

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,250
all words that belong
either to L1 or to L2,

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,630
similarly the intersection
of two languages L1 and L2

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,120
is formed by those words that
 belong to both languages,

17
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,090
finally, the complementary of a language
 L over a given alphabet sigma

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,380
consists of the set of words
 that do not belong to L

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,100
To illustrate the behavior of
 these language operations

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,030
let's consider initially the
three finite languages shown,

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,680
the language L1 formed by
 three words: lambda,

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,210
ab, and aab; language L2
made up of four words

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,800
a, ab, ba, and bbab;

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,540
and the language L3 formed
by the words whose length

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,670
is less than or
equal to two

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,080
the union of L1 and L2
consists of considering

27
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,660
all words that belong
 to L1 and L2

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,210
the intersection
 of L1 and L3

29
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,400
is formed by those
 words of L1

30
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,920
having a length less
than or equal to two

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,960
and the complementary of L3
is formed by those words

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,560
which do not
belong to L3

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,390
that is, the words on the
alphabet a, b whose length is

34
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,630
greater than or
equal to three

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,330
For a second set of examples
 consider the language L1

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,480
as the language of words
over the alphabet a, b

37
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,890
containing an odd number of
as and an odd number of bs

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,360
the language L2 as the set of
words over the alphabet a, b

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,760
with an even
number of as

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,100
and the language L3 as the set of
 words over the alphabet a, b

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,850
which do not contain
 the segment ba

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,380
the union of the language
 L1 and L2 contains

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,500
all words over the
 alphabet a, b

44
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,450
that have an even number of
as or an odd number of bs

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,290
the intersection of
language L1 and L3

46
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,080
contains the words formed by
a sequence of as followed

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,370
of a sequence of bs

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,360
and where the number
of as and bs is odd

49
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,670
and complementary to L1
 is the set of words

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,000
with an even number of as
or an even number of bs

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,120
we note here that other
operations on languages can

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,840
be described as a composition
 of Boolean operations

53
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,270
for example, the difference of
 languages, that is the set

54
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,660
of words that belong to one of them
 and do not belong to the second

55
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,040
can be described as the intersection
 of the first language

56
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,910
with the complementary
 of the second

57
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,460
As an example, considering
 language L1 as the set

58
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,040
of words on alphabet a, b
with an odd number of as

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,120
and the language L2 as the set
of words on the alphabet a, b

60
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,800
with an even
number of bs

61
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,290
the difference
of L1 with L2

62
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,830
contains the words

63
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,700
with odd number of as and
 a pair number of bs

64
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,400
similarly the symmetrical
difference of two languages L1

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,840
L2 contains all the words
that belong exclusively

66
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,820
to one of the two languages,
 and can be described

67
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,360
using Boolean operations such
 as the intersection of

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,480
first of them with the
complementary of the second

69
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,230
united to the intersection of the second of the
languages with the complementary of the first

70
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,680
An example, considering
 the set of words on

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,590
alphabet a b with an
even number of as

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,470
and the set of words over alphabet
 a, b with an even number of bs

73
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,660
the symmetric difference contains
those words over the alphabet a, b

74
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,510
such that, if the number of as is
even then the number of bs is odd,

75
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,930
and if the number of as is
odd then the number of bs

76
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,190
in the word is even.
