00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,520
In this video a set of operations on formal
 languages is intuitively presented 

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,520
of operations on formal languages
 is intuitively presented 

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,220
it is important to note the intuitive
 nature of the explanation

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,870
and that the study of these operations
implies to consult the bibliography

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,940
and the rest of
available material.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,830
The first operation presented
 is the quotient of a

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,380
language with
respect to a word

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,070
given a sigma alphabet
and a language over it

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,340
a way of seeing at the quotient
 of L respect to a word u

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,730
is to consider exclusively
 the words of language

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,450
that have u as
 a prefix,

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,530
in such a way that the ratio of L
to the word u can be described

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,050
as the set of all suffixes
 of u in the words in L

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,780
Another equivalent description
 of this operation

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,570
is to see the quotient of
 L respect to a word u

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,670
as the set of all words such
that its concatenation to

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,840
u on the right. result in a
word that belongs to L.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,760
As a first example to illustrate the
behavior of the operation quotient

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,220
let us consider the language of
words over the alphabet a, b

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,250
which contains
the segment aa,

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,310
the quotient of this language
 respect to the word aa

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,540
equals the language
 a, b star

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,760
whereas the quotient of L1
respect to the word bba

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,350
can be seen as the union
 of two languages:

25
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,230
the one of word over the alphabet
a,b beginning with b, and that

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,880
contains segment aa

27
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,450
united to the language of words over
the alphabet a, b beginning with a.

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,130
As a second example let us consider
 the language of words over

29
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,660
the alphabet a, b containing
 an odd number of as

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,270
the quotient of this language
 respect to the word bab

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,280
is equal to the set of words
over the same alphabet that

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,920
contain an even
number of as

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,620
whereas the quotient of the language
 L2 with respect to the word b

34
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,400
is equal to the
same language L2.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,050
We now consider the operations
homomorphism and inverse homomorphism.

36
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,580
As a first step it is necessary to
define the homomorphism operation

37
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,550
which is considered as any total
function h from sigma on delta star.

38
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:33,790
that is, a function h such that
each symbol of the alphabet sigma

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,240
is mapped into a word over
 the alphabet delta.

40
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,890
As an example of
 homomorphism

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:47,710
let us consider the alphabets sigma equal
 to a, b and delta equal to zero, one;

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,120
an homomorphism operation can be
defined by considering the image

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,460
of a as the word 00

44
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,550
and the image of b according the
 homomorphism as the word 1.

45
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,590
The extension of the homomorphism
 operation to words

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,300
is done by applying the homomorphism
 to every symbol of the word

47
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,330
so, for example, the
homomorphism of the word

48
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,110
abba consists on first considering
 the homomorphism of a, 00

49
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,230
then the homomorphism
 of b, 1

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,370
again the homomorphism
 of b, 1

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,980
and finally the homomorphism
 of the symbol a, 00.

52
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,700
Similarly the homomorphism
of the word baba is equal

53
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,100
to the word 100100.

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,870
Thus, given an homomorphism
from sigma in delta star

55
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,540
and a language over
the alphabet sigma,

56
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,580
we will consider the set of
words over the alphabet delta

57
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,900
such that, they are an image, according
 to the homomorphism, of some

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,320
word in the language L.

59
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,700
The set of homomorphisms
of all the words of L

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,430
is what is known as the
homomorphism of the language.

61
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,740
An example to illustrate the
behavior of the homomorphism

62
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,330
operation of a language we
 consider the language

63
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,740
of words over the
alphabet a, b, c

64
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,800
such that contain as many symbols
 a as symbols b and c added

65
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,350
being for example the homomorphism the
 one that associates the symbol a

66
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,750
to the word 0, the symbol
 b to the empty word,

67
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,600
and the symbol c
to the word one

68
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,560
the homomorphism of the language
 is equal to the set of words

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,910
over the alphabet zero, one such
that contain more symbols zero

70
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,420
than one such
that contain

71
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,860
at least as many zero
symbols as symbols one.

72
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,310
To define the inverse
homomorphism of a language

73
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,120
given any homomorphism
sigma on delta star

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,160
and an L language over the alphabet delta,
we will consider all the words over sigma

75
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,230
whose image according to the
homomorphism belongs to language.

76
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,950
The set of all these words
is what constitutes the

77
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,440
known as inverse
homomorphism of language.

78
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,930
As a first example to
illustrate the behavior of

79
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,290
the inverse homomorphism
 of a language

80
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,990
we consider the finite
 language shown

81
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,330
and the homomorphism of the alphabet
a, b, c on the set zero, one star

82
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,600
such that it associates the
symbol a with the word 0,

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,010
the symbol b to
the word 11,

84
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,970
and the symbol c
to the word 110,

85
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,630
the inverse homomorphism of the language
L is equal to the finite language shown

86
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,840
because the homomorphism of any other
 word over the alphabet a, b, c

87
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,960
does not belong to
the language L.

88
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,660
As a second example we consider
 the language of words

89
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,530
over the alphabet 0, 1
ending with a symbol 1

90
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:21,180
and the homomorphism of the alphabet a,
 b, c, on words of the alphabet 0, 1

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,650
such that it maps the symbol a
the word 0, and the symbol b to

92
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,530
the word 01. The inverse homomorphism
 of language L is equal to

93
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,920
set of words over alphabet
 ab that end with b.

94
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,610
Finally, we consider the definition
 of operations on languages

95
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,170
as the extension of other operations
 defined operations on words

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,250
when the image of a
word is another word,

97
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,930
in order to define the extension to
languages it is enough to consider the

98
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,190
set of all images of
words in the language.

99
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,600
As an example, considering the
operation reverse of a word

100
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,020
this operation
can be extended

101
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,560
to define the reverse of a
language as the set of reverses

102
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,480
of all words in
the language.

103
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,660
When the result of the operation
 on words is a language

104
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,970
the extension is made up
considering the union of all

105
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,490
languages obtained as an image
 of a word in the language.

106
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,820
An example is the consideration
 of the operation prefixes

107
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,540
of a word,

108
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,590
the extension is made up
considering the union

109
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,180
of the prefixes of all
words in the language.
