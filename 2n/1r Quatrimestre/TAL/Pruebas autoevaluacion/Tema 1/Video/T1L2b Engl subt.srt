00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,340
In this video, some operations based on the product
 of formal languages are intuitively explained

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,340
based on the product of formal
languages are intuitively explained

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,690
we point out the intuitive
nature of the explanation

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,480
and refer to the student to the
recommended bibliography and

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,990
the rest of the material available
to delve into more formal aspects

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,640
Of course, this video should begin by dealing
 with the product of formal languages

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,770
that, given two languages L1
and L2 over a Sigma alphabet,

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,830
is defined as the set of
words that can be obtained

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,670
by concatenating a word
in the first language

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,200
and another word in the second
language, regardless the result

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,700
belongs to the
first language,

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,960
to L2, or to
none of them.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,640
As a first example, consider the
two finite languages in the image

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,020
the product of these languages,
that can be noted using the two

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,640
ways shown in
the image,

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,370
contains all the words that can
 be divided into two factors

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,410
the first of them in L1
and the second in L2

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,120
As another example, let's consider
the three languages in the image

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,550
the first of them is the language
 of words over alphabet a, b

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,210
that end with a

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,640
the second of them is the
set of words on the same

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,770
alphabet beginning
with the symbol b

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,230
and the third the set of words over
the alphabet a, b with exactly one b

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,570
where this symbol is the
 suffix of the word.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,460
The product of
 L1 and L2

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,400
results in the set of words
 containing segment ab,

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,480
and the product of
languages L1 and L3

28
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,560
results in the set of
words over alphabet a, b

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,500
such that ab is a
suffix of the word

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,200
Once the product of languages has
 been defined, the power of a

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,710
language L over an alphabet sigma
is defined as the concatenation

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,380
of a serie of words
in the language,

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,760
in such a way that the n-th power
of the language is composed by

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,360
all the words that are the result
of concatenating n words in L.

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,470
As a first example, let us consider
 the finite language that

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,330
contains only
two words,

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,980
lambda and the word a

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,410
the third power of this language
contains all the words formed

39
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,270
by a number less than or equal
 to three of symbols a.

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,800
As a second example, consider the
 language formed by the words

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,860
which are the result of
concatenating to a sequence

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,880
of n symbols b
a symbol a,

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,310
the fourth power of this language
 contains all the words

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,890
with exactly four as being one
of them suffix of the word.

45
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,450
although the n-th power of a
language contains exclusively

46
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,120
the words that can be obtained by
 concatenation of n words of L

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,870
the concatenation of any number
 of words in the language

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,900
always returns a word that belongs to
 the star closure of the language

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,970
this word will also belong to the
positive closure of the language

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,200
if at least one of the words of
the language has been considered

51
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,790
another way to define
the star closure of L

52
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,600
or L star, is as the union of
all the powers of language,

53
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,390
similarly, the positive closure
 of l or L plus is defined

54
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,580
as the union of all the powers of
the language greater than zero.

55
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,690
As examples to illustrate these
 operations we will consider

56
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,590
languages in the
 image, L1

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,110
that contains only one
 word, the word a:

58
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,010
L2 which is also finite and
contains the words lambda

59
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,830
b, ba. and bb; and language
 L3 containing the words

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,620
formed by a sequence of symbols
 b of any length, that end

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,460
with a symbol a. In the first
 case the star closure of 

62
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,460
case the star
closure of l 

63
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,460
case the star
closure of l 

64
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,010
L1 contains the words formed
 by a sequence of symbols

65
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,300
a of any length,

66
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,200
and the positive closure of L1
 contains the words formed

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,710
by sequences of symbols
of length at least one.

68
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,240
When the star and positive
closure operations are applied

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,560
on language L2, results the
 same language, that is,

70
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,570
the language of words on alphabet
 a, b that do not contain

71
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,940
the segment aa and do not
start with the symbol a.

72
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,550
In the third case, the star
 closure of language L3

73
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,270
contains those words
over alphabet a,b such

74
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,640
that a is a suffix of the word,
the word ends with the symbol a,

75
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,250
together with the
 word lambda.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,020
Positive closing of the
language L3 contains strictly

77
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,770
the set of words on alphabet
 a, b that end with a.
